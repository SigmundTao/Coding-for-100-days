# Coding-for-100-days

Hi! I am Tao, a 22 Year old from the UK. I dropped out of school at 17 and fell down a rabbit hole of bad habits. Fast forward 5 years and now im still working the same dead end job I had back then. I want better for myself so, I have decided to commit to this challenge. I have learned small bits of code over the last few years but i'd always give up after a few days or weeks and forget it all. I am almost finished with freeCodeCamp's javaScript Course and I finished their HTML & CSS one earlier this year. 

During the slightly consistent periods of learning I had, I noticed that I genuinely enjoy to code. I want to make cool shit. That is fun to work on but that also can help people. I'm lightyears away from doing that currently but that is the goal. I have tried to commit to a multitude of things in the passed and failed miserably each time. This time im going to keep it simple: 1 hour of coding minimum a day & post my progress on X and GitHub each day. I will be posting everything I do into this repository, with a folder for each individual day.

My goal for the end of the 100 days is to launch a piece of software and to have coded everyday without fail. If you're at all interested in my journey please follow along. See you in 100 days!
