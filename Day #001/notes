Today I used API for the first time. I built a super simple weather app. It took me around 2.5 hours or so.
I struggled a lot with reading the documentation for the API, its been a long time since ive read anything like it.
After a while though, I understood and the rest was pretty straightforward. I want to see what else i can make
with API tomorrow.

Good 1st day down.
